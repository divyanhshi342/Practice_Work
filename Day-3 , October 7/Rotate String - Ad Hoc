/*
Scturtle likes strings very much. He is getting bored today, because he has already completed this week's task and doesn't have anything else to do.
So he starts left-rotating a string.
If the length of the string is n , then he will rotate it n times and note down the result of each rotation on a paper.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T , which represents the number of test cases to follow. Then follows T lines, which represent a test case each.
Each test case contains a string, S , which consists of lower case latin characters a-z only.

Output Format
For each test case, print all the rotations, r1,r2...rn , separated by a space.
