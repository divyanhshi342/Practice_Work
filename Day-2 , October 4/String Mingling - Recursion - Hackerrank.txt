/*
Pawel and Shaka recently became friends. They believe their friendship will last forever if they merge their favorite strings
The lengths of their favorite strings are the same,n . Mingling two strings, P = p1p2...pn and Q = q1q2...qn, both of length n , will result in the creation of a new string R of length 2xn. It will have the following structure:
R = p1q1p2q2...pnqn
You are given two strings P (Pawel's favorite) and Q (Shaka's favorite), determine the mingled string R .

Input Format

The first line of input contains the string P and Q.
The second line contains R.

Output Format

Print the mingled string,R.
